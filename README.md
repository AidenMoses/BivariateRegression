# Advertising Data Analysis

This is a Python script for analyzing advertising data and performing regression analysis to understand the relationship between advertising spending and sales. The code uses various libraries, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, and `sklearn`, to visualize the data and calculate regression models.

## Features

- Analyzes advertising data to understand the impact on sales.
- Visualizes the data using scatter plots and regression lines.
- Performs linear and polynomial regression analysis.
- Provides summaries of regression models.
- Includes examples of working with both dense and sparse datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this code, you will need:

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- The following Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, and `sklearn`.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advertising-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd advertising-data-analysis
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. Make sure you've followed the installation steps above.

2. Ensure that you have the advertising data file (`Advertising.csv`) in the same directory as the script.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python advertising_data_analysis.py
   ```

4. The script will perform various analyses on the advertising data and generate visualizations and regression models.
